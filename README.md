## Tomatometer Grapher

#### I PLAN ON PUTTING THIS PROJECT ONLINE. I AM CURRENTLY LEARNING NODEJS, AND WILL BE GOING ABOUT ADDING THIS ONLINE. THEREFORE, I WON'T BE PROVIDING UPDATES TO THIS CODE. WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE NEW GITHUB REPO ONCE IT IS MADE. TREAT THIS AS v1.

##### The Tomatometer Grapher is a visualization tool, that graphs the overall Rotten Tomatoes score of a given actor/actress or director. To start the program, run main.py (previously gui.py).
##### The framework for this project was inspired largely by SentDex's great Tkinter tutorial. I used that as a starting point, and have gradually been expanding on that via the Tkinter and matplotlib documentation

~~Currently working on:~~
 ~~- Adding another mode where the trend can be viewed for films in a given franchise (ie Marvel or Star Wars).~~
 ~~- I realize that edge detection with annotations have issues whenever the window is expanded/shrunk. I'll work on a fix for this.~~
 ~~- Transferring Python code to an executable file using cx_Freeze.~~

~~Changes to (potentially) come:~~
~~- Tick boxes for options to change the plot~~
~~- Perhaps more information in the annotation, including box office~~
~~- Options in the menu bar, including different themes, and the option to save a graph as an image~~
