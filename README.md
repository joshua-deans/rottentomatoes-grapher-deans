# Tomatometer Grapher

#### The Tomatometer Grapher is a visualization tool, that graphs the overall Rotten Tomatoes score of a given actor/actress or director. To start the program, run gui.py.

### Changes to (potentially) come:
- More bugs regarding web scraping to be fixed.
- Tick boxes for options to change the plot
- Tweak the visuals so that they look a bit sleeker.
- Perhaps more information in the annotation, including box office
- Options in the menu bar, including different themes, and the option to save a graph as an image
- Eventually, the biggest upgrade will be to have another mode where the trend can be viewed for films in a given franchise (ie Marvel or Star Wars). Perhaps it would even be cool to have a comparison feature so you could compare Star Wars vs Lord of the Rings, or Marvel vs DC.
